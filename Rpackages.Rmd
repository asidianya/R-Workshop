## What is a function in R?


An R function is created by using the keyword *function*. The basic syntax of an R function definition is as follows:


```{r}
function_name <- function(arg_1,..) {
   Function_body 
}
```

The different parts of a function are:

* Function Name − This is the actual name of the function. It is stored in the R environment as its name. 

* Arguments − This is an placeholder to pass an input value into your function (i.e. $f(x)$). 

* Function Body − The  function contains the statements that determines what the function does. 

### Example 1:

```{r}
#Create a function to print out the values for perfect squares. 
perfect.squares<-function(x){for (x in 1:10){
  if(x%%x == 0)
    b<-x^2
  print (b)
}}

#pass a value to the function
perfect.squares(10)
```


Here is how the function is stored as an object in the R environment:

</center>

### Example 2:

```{r}
#Create a function with more than one argument
translate<-function(x,y){
  if (x=="NA"){x=0}
  else if (x!="NA"){x=x}
  print(x)
  if (y== -1){y="NA"}
  else if (y!=-1){y=y}
  print(y)

}


#Testing the function with input values 
x<-"NA"
y<-"-1"

x2<-1
y2<-0

translate(x, y)
translate(x2, y2)
```

As an aside, in this example I could have stuck to the general structure of:

<center>
if (test_expression) {
statement1
} 
else {
statement2
}
</center>

However, the else if is useful if one wants to test more conditions.  

### Ifelse function in R

In order to understand the brilliance of this function let's go back to the toy example 2.

```{r}
x3<-c(0, "NA", 1)
y3<-c(-1, "NA", 80)

translate(x3,y3)
```

The problem is revealed in the warning message. The vector has length 3 but the if statement can only evaluate one condition at a time. 

The `ifelse` is a built in base R function that returns a value with the same length as the test, rather than the evaluation at the first element. The elements selected from either `yes` or `no` depend on whether the `yes` condition is true or false. 

```{r}
z<-x3
ifelse(z==0, "NA", z)
```
This function will be an important component of the mini R package I developed for this workshop.
